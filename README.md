## About

`fest` is a Python-based implementation of a space-time finite element scheme. This project provides a framework for solving partial differential equations using finite element methods that consider both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.

## Features

- **Space-Time Finite Element Method**: Integrates spatial and temporal discretization for solving PDEs.
- **Modular Design**: Allows for easy extension and customization of finite element formulations.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed explanations and examples to guide users through the implementation.
